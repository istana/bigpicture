# Architecture and Components

## Renderer - renders source text (plaintext, Markdown, Textile) to HTML (presentation language), possibly shell escaped text and others. (@TODO:How to handle greyscale stuff? Handle it?)


## Quasi routes

PUT /upload {guid=c606d903-c314-4875-bade-7c9c7e37d62a}
PUT /upload-resumable {guid=c606d903-c314-4875-bade-7c9c7e37d62a, part=xx, offset=yy}

/admin/settings
/admin/monitoring - index
/admin/statistics - index

standard Rails CRUD

GET /admin/content/index
GET /admin/content/new
POST /admin/content/create
...

- split up settings and content creation (in comparison with PrestaShop)
- add monitoring (performance (response times) and anomalies) and statistics (day, week, year, trends/anomalies)
