# Technical requirements

- response time 20ms (including TCP and TLS handshake) - TLSv1.3 has faster handshake than v1.2 (see cloudflare blog), max 100ms (99%)
- theming: two implementations - legacy one HTML4.1+CSS2.1+no Javascript (use forms), one modern reactive stuff, but fast
- UI - UI must never be slow or stutter even a little bit (but you can add fullHD background videos to the theme later)
- really, UI must never be slow, no compromise - limit animations and transitions - they only masks data loading
- no infinite loading circles - give feedback after 10 seconds - and handle network outages or stucks properly
- use only strong ciphers and ideally TLSv1.2 ad newer (v1.3 by default) and offer HTTP2
- never use Adobe (Macromedia) Flash or browser plugins
